# SkynetA11y PDF Remediation (Statamic Addon)

The **SkynetA11y PDF Remediation** addon brings **PDF Accessibility Remediation for WCAG & PDF/UA Compliance** directly into your Statamic Control Panel. It is both a **PDF Accessibility Checker** and an **AI Remediation Tool**: upload documents or crawl your website for them, let AI repair the accessibility barriers automatically, review every check that was applied, and download conformant files — without leaving your own admin area.

It fixes the barriers that make PDFs unusable with assistive technology: missing tags, incorrect reading order, inaccessible forms and tables, images without alternate text, and absent document structure, language and metadata.

It supports compliance with **WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, PDF/UA, ADA, Section 508, AODA, and EN 301 549 (EAA)**. With plain-language explanations and before/after examples for every check, even non-technical users can understand what was fixed and why it mattered.

It is a sibling of the `skynettechnologies/statamic-all-in-one-accessibility` and `skynettechnologies/statamic-skynet-accessibility-video-subtitle` addons and follows the same structure: a Control Panel tool under **Tools**.

This addon is designed for:

- Businesses of all sizes
- Enterprises
- Government and public sector entities
- Website owners
- E-commerce platforms
- Development and maintenance agencies

## Why SkynetA11y PDF Remediation?

PDFs are where accessibility compliance quietly fails. A site can pass every page-level audit and still publish hundreds of untagged documents — reports, forms, invoices, policies — that screen readers cannot navigate at all.

Remediating them by hand is slow and expensive. This addon makes it a routine part of publishing: documents are discovered, repaired and re-checked inside the Control Panel your team already uses, so accessible PDFs become the default rather than a project.

## Key Features

- **SkynetA11y PDF Remediation** – Automated repair of tags, reading order, alt text, headings, tables and metadata.
- **PDF Accessibility Checker** – Every check reported individually, expandable   to a plain-language explanation and a before/after example.
- **Upload or Crawl** – Add files by drag and drop, or sweep your website for every PDF it links to.
- **Free Trial** – The free plan covers your first 5 pages; paid plans scale from 50 to 10,000 pages.
- **Bulk Remediation** – Select any number of documents and process them in one run, with live progress.
- **Deep Tag Scan** – Post-remediation verification against the document's tag tree, not just its declared metadata.
- **Authenticated Downloads** – Remediated files are delivered over an authenticated session, never a public link.
- **No Settings Screen** – Nothing to paste and nothing to wire up. One short dialog asks for a name, email and domain the first time it is needed, and never again.
- **Integration with All in One Accessibility® Dashboard** – Plans, usage and billing stay in one place.

## Compliance Standards Supported

- WCAG 2.0, 2.1, 2.2
- PDF/UA (ISO 14289)
- ADA
- Section 508
- AODA
- EN 301 549 (EU / European Accessibility Act)

## Requirements

- Statamic 5 or 6
- PHP 8.1+

## Installation

```bash
composer require skynettechnologies/statamic-skyneta11y-pdf-remediation
```

Publish the public assets (CSS / JS / images) and, optionally, the config:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="skynettechnologies/statamic-skyneta11y-pdf-remediation-assets"
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="skynettechnologies/statamic-skyneta11y-pdf-remediation-config"
```

Or copy the assets with the bundled command:

```bash
php please skynet-pdf-remediation:copy-assets
```

## Usage

Open **Tools -> SkynetA11y PDF Remediation** in the Control Panel. The workspace has three tabs:

- **Upload** - drag and drop PDFs (up to 50 MB, unencrypted) and add them for AI remediation.
- **Website Scan** - crawl the connected domain for linked PDFs.
- **Remediated** - browse and download remediated PDFs.

The first time you upload a PDF or run a website scan, a short dialog asks for a name, email and domain. The name and email are pre-filled from the logged-in user and the domain defaults to the current site, so you usually just confirm. The account is provisioned only when you submit that dialog, and you are not asked again on that browser.

Access is gated by the **Access SkynetA11y PDF Remediation** permission, assignable under **Users -> Roles**.

## How It Works

1. **Add Your PDFs** – Upload files, or crawl your website for every PDF it links to.
2. **Run AI Remediation** – Select documents and process them in bulk; progress is reported live.
3. **Review & Download** – Inspect each accessibility check with its explanation and before/after example, then download the conformant file.

## CORS Policy Configuration

The dashboard calls the remediation API directly from the browser, so the API origin must allow your Control Panel origin. Ensure the following URLs are allowed in your CORS configuration or trusted domains list.

| **Domain**                                 | **Description**                     | **Usage**                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `https://livepdfapi.skynettechnologies.us` | SkynetA11y PDF Remediation API      | Documents, remediation jobs, downloads |
| `https://ada.skynettechnologies.us`        | All in One Accessibility® Dashboard | Plan upgrades via autologin            |

### Instructions

1. Update your server's CORS configuration to include these URLs.
2. Ensure wildcard subdomains (`*`) are supported where necessary.
3. Verify the application functionality by testing requests to these domains.
4. If issues persist, consult the documentation for CORS configuration guidance.

If your site sends a `Content-Security-Policy`, both origins also need to be in its `connect-src`, or the browser will block the requests before they are made.
